Algorithm BFS(Graph, start):

1. Create an empty set VISITED
2. Create an empty queue Q
3. Enqueue start node into Q

4. While Q is not empty:
      a. Dequeue a node N from Q
      b. If N is not in VISITED:
            i.   Print N
            ii.  Add N to VISITED
            iii. Enqueue all adjacent nodes of N from Graph into Q

5. End
Algorithm DFS(Graph, start):

1. Create an empty set VISITED

2. Define a recursive function DFS_Visit(node):
      a. If node is not in VISITED:
            i.   Print node
            ii.  Add node to VISITED
            iii. For each adjacent node of node in Graph:
                     Call DFS_Visit(adjacent node)

3. Call DFS_Visit(start)

4. End
